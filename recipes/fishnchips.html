    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the grill. Arrange the peppers and mushrooms on a baking sheet and grill them for 4 to 5 minutes,

            heat
            for about 30 to 40 seconds until melted.</li>
        <li>Add a quarter of the vegetable mixture to one side of the tortilla, then fold it in half, over the filling.
            Cook
            for a few moments, then slide it onto a warm serving plate. Keep warm.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining tortillas. Serve with the salad leaves, grated carrot and celery.</li>
