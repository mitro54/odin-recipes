    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix some of the chopped onion and garlic with the mince. Shape the mince into small balls about half the
            size of a
            golf ball.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan and brown the meatballs on all sides. Remove and put on to a plate.
        </li>
        <li>Add the remaining onion to the frying pan and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until soft. Add the remaining garlic
            and cook
            for another minute.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes, tomato purée, herbs, mushrooms and peppers to the pan with 150ml water. Bring to the boil,
            then
            add the meatballs. Reduce the heat, cover with a lid and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>About 10 minutes before serving, put the pasta on to cook in plenty of boiling water. Serve with the
            meatballs and
            tomato sauce.</li>
    </ol>
